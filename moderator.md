# 1) in current design, Actor manages message passing, it doesn't care the content of the messages; 2) we need a structure that can manage messages, i.e. pick which message to pass on to another channel based on some conditions, I wonder if we should create another type of moderator agent that can do this, which manipulate message passing by creating new subscriptions of existing agents, say, the task agent started with being subscriber of "chat" group, when the time come to reply, the moderator agent adds task agent to "judge" group where judge has been ready; 3) is there already established pattern for what I've described? 4) propose structure to do this job; 5) in above code, you tried to add method to Router so that Router can manipulate messages, we don't go that way for now

---
Below is an approach you can consider. In many actor‐based systems the router or mediator is “dumb” in that it passes messages regardless of content—instead, you may want a dedicated moderator (or mediator) actor to examine message content and modify routing behavior. This approach is related to the established Mediator pattern (and also overlaps with Pub/Sub with content‐based filtering).

## Proposed Structure

- **Moderator Actor**
 -  Runs concurrently with your router and agents.
 -  Subscribes to the “chat” group and inspects incoming messages.
 -  When a task agent replies with a solution, it extracts the content and then triggers new routing logic. For instance, it might send a command to the router to subscribe the task agent to the “judge” group, or it could forward a merged message (combining the original task and its solution) directly to the judge group.
- **Router Actor (or Message Broker)**
 -  Remains responsible for the low-level mechanics of message passing.
 -  Its commands are kept content‐agnostic.
 -  The moderator instructs the router via separate commands (for example, subscribe or unsubscribe messages) or even as explicit routing requests.


## Example Interaction Flow

| Step | Action | Actor Involved | Outcome |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Task agent receives a task from “chat”. | Router delivers task via standard routing. | Task agent processes and sends a reply on “chat”. |
| 2 | Moderator monitors messages on “chat” and detects a reply. | Moderator Actor | Moderator extracts the solution from the task agent’s reply. |
| 3 | Moderator instructs the router to modify subscriptions. | Moderator sends a command (e.g., SubscribeAgent) to the Router. | Task agent is added to the “judge” group (or the message is forwarded to “judge”). |
| 4 | Judge agent receives the merged (task + solution) message or handles the forwarded message. | Router delivers message to judge agents. | Judge agent processes and evaluates the solution. |

## Implementation Sketch

1. **Moderator Actor**
Create a new actor, say `ModeratorActor`, whose state includes a reference to the router and a store for the latest task reply. Its behavior might include:

```rust
pub enum ModeratorCommand {
    // Command to process a new chat message.
    ProcessChatMessage { message: Message },
    // Command to trigger subscription changes.
    PromoteAgent { agent_id: AgentId, to_topic: TopicId },
    // … other moderator-specific commands.
}
```

And in its handler:

```rust
async fn handle(&self, _myself: ActorRef<ModeratorCommand>, msg: ModeratorCommand, state: &mut ModeratorState) -> Result<(), ActorProcessingErr> {
    match msg {
        ModeratorCommand::ProcessChatMessage { message } => {
            // Check if the message contains a candidate reply from a task agent.
            if let Content::Text(text) = message.get_content() {
                // Save reply in the state, if needed.
                state.latest_task_reply = Some(text.clone());
                // Optionally, instruct the router to promote the task agent.
                // For example, send a message to the router to subscribe the sender to the judge group.
            }
        }
        ModeratorCommand::PromoteAgent { agent_id, to_topic } => {
            // Forward a command to the router to add the agent to the target topic.
            // router_ref.cast(RouterCommand::SubscribeAgent { agent_id, topic: to_topic });
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

2. **Integrating with the Router**
Instead of adding message manipulation hooks directly into the router, the moderator:
    - Receives messages (either through subscription to the “chat” group or via the router forwarding specific messages).
    - After processing, it decides which messages need to be forwarded or which subscriptions should change.
    - Then, it instructs the router by sending commands such as `SubscribeAgent` or a custom `ForwardMessage` command.

## Established Patterns

This design leverages a few well-known patterns:

- **Mediator Pattern:**
 A dedicated actor (the moderator) centralizes the decision‐making for inter-actor communications rather than letting each actor handle its message routing logic. This decouples the routing decision from the low-level message transport layer.
- **Content-Based Routing:**
 The moderator examines message content and decides where to forward them. This pattern is common in distributed messaging systems and event-driven architectures.
- **Publish-Subscribe with Dynamic Subscriptions:**
 Rather than statically subscribing agents to topics, the moderator can modify subscriptions on the fly based on application logic. This is similar to a dynamic pub/sub broker that uses rules (or filters) to change message flow.


## Summary

Yes—you can introduce a dedicated moderator actor that acts as a mediator for message flow. Instead of hardcoding logic inside the router that is unaware of message content, this moderator can examine messages sent on the “chat” channel and then, based on conditions (for example, when a solution is ready), modify subscriptions (or forward merged messages) so that task agents or their replies are delivered to the judge group. This pattern is well established and combines ideas from the Mediator pattern and content-based routing.
